# Introduction to Python
# Python is a high-level, interpreted programming language known for its simplicity and readability. It was created by Guido van Rossum and first released in 1991. Python emphasizes code readability and allows developers to express concepts in fewer lines of code compared to other programming languages.

# Key Features of Python:
# 1. Easy to Learn: Python has a clean and straightforward syntax, making it beginner-friendly and easy to understand.
# 2. Readability: Python code is highly readable, resembling the English language. This makes it easier to write and maintain Python programs.
# 3. Versatility: Python is a versatile language used for various purposes, including web development, data analysis, machine learning, artificial intelligence, scripting, and more.
# 4. Large Standard Library: Python comes with a rich collection of modules and libraries, providing ready-to-use functions and tools for different tasks.
# 5. Cross-Platform Compatibility: Python programs can run on different operating systems such as Windows, macOS, and Linux, making it highly portable.
# 6. Dynamically Typed: Python is dynamically typed, meaning you don't need to explicitly define variable types. It offers flexibility but requires attention to variable assignments.
# 7. Extensive Community Support: Python has a vibrant and supportive community. You can find numerous resources, documentation, and active forums to seek help and share knowledge.

# Getting Started:
# To start coding in Python, you need to install Python on your computer. Visit the official Python website (python.org) and download the latest version suitable for your operating system. Python provides an interactive shell called the Python interpreter, where you can run Python code line by line.

# Python Syntax:
# Python uses indentation to define code blocks instead of using braces ({}) like many other programming languages. This indentation ensures code readability and enforces a consistent coding style.

# Example:

# Hello, World! program
print("Hello, World!")
