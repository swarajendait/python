# Lists:
# A list is an ordered collection of items that can be of different data types. It is mutable, which means its elements can be modified. Here are some key aspects of lists:
# - Creating a List: Lists are defined by enclosing comma-separated values within square brackets [].
# - Indexing and Slicing: Similar to strings, you can access elements in a list using indices and slicing.
# - Modifying Elements: Lists allow you to modify individual elements by assigning new values to specific indices.
# - List Methods: Python provides several built-in methods for manipulating lists, such as append(), extend(), insert(), remove(), and more.
